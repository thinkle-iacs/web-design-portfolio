      ways (e.g. on a left-right and top-bottom axis).
    </li>
    <li>
      You pay close attention to alignment and spacing, creating even spacings
      and alignments or breaking them deliberately for effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      You structure your HTML and CSS in a way that makes your layout easy to
      adjust and understand, using features such as flexbox or CSS grid to lay
      out your page.
