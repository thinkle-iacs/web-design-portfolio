      This repository contains descriptors for skills that my introductory web
      design students need to demonstrate.
    </p>
    <p>This itself is not meant to be beautiful :)</p>
    <p>
      Skills are divided into categories based on the strand system our science
      department uses:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="mod/">mod</a> - Modeling. Understanding the abstractions behind
        web pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="eu/">eu</a> - Enduring Understanding. Used for long term
        comprehension of concepts. In Web Design, I use this strand for design
        skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="ps/">ps</a> - Problem Solving. In web design I use Problem
        Solving for finding a way through challenging design or coding problems.
      </li>
    </ul>
