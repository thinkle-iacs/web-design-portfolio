  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    I should have given you a template which refers to
    <a href="https://github.com/thinkle/sample-webdesign-student-portfolio">
      this sample portfolio </a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    That page includes code to automatically pull in descriptions of standards
    <em>and</em> to make it easy for you to include code snippets in your
    portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
    For your portfolio, you will be demonstrating mastery of each skill listed
    here. The list of skills span both coding concepts and design concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each case, you will want to include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Links to full projects showing off the skills in question.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code snippets highlighting your understanding of the concepts/skills
        you are supposed to demonstrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        A brief reflection about the skill (as needed). For simple skills, there's
        not need to explain the obvious; but for more open-ended items, such as
        items highlighting design sense, you should explain your thinking.
      </li>
    </ul>     
  </p>
  <p>
    I recommend that you organize your portfolio into sections, with each
    &lt;section&gt; including the standards you are addressing and showing work and code
    excerpts highlighting your work.
  </p>
  <p>To insert my "standard" blurb, you simply need to add the correct code
    to a site with my demo script on it. For example, 
    <pre>&lt;div class="descriptor data-ref="code/basic-html"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre> 
    will insert the blurb about basic HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should also customize the look and feel of your portfolio as you move
    through the course, making it grow more personalized and unique over time.
