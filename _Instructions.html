  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    I should have given you a template which refers to
    <a href="https://github.com/thinkle/sample-webdesign-student-portfolio">
      this sample portfolio </a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    That page includes code to automatically pull in descriptions of standards
    <em>and</em> to make it easy for you to include code snippets in your
    portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
    For your portfolio, you will be demonstrating mastery of each skill listed
    here. The list of skills span both coding concepts and design concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each case, you will want to include links to full projects showing off
    your web design as well as code snippets showing that you understand the
    skills in question.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recommend that you organize your portfolio into sections, with each
    section including the standards you are addressing and showing work and code
    excerpts highlighting your work.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should also customize the look and feel of your portfolio as you move
    through the course, making it grow more personalized and unique over time.
